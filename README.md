# Pathfinder
Program Description:

The program reads an input file and prints out the number of nodes and corresponding adjacency matrix. The program finds all possible path for all pairs of nodes. Only non looping paths are printed.
If no path exists, the program prints a message indicating that. There are 3 input files included with the document. The original input file, graphinput, contains 3 matrices. The other 2 input files
, graphinput2 and graphinput3, are intended to test out situations where no path exist and to show that the program does what it's supposed to do with other matrices.
